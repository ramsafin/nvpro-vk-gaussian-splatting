This project is a **testbed** to explore and compare various approaches to **real-time visualization** of **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [[Kerbl2023](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/)]** and related evolutions. 

This project is not a 3DGS reconstruction tool — it is a viewer. It does not generate or train models, only tries to visualize them at the highest possible speed.

By evaluating various techniques and optimizations, we aim to provide valuable insights into **performance, quality, and implementation trade-offs** when using the **Vulkan API**.

This project implements several **rendering pipelines** based on **rasterization**, **ray tracing**, and **hybrid** approaches. It can be used as a lab for developers or as a day-to-day viewer for your splats. 

## Quick Start

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_gaussian_splatting/releases) for your OS
    * decompress the archive
    * run the executable vk_gaussian_splatting[.exe]
2. [Download this small 3DGS flowers model](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/ProGraphics/nvpro-samples/flowers_1.zip) 
    * decompress the archive
    * drag and drop the file flowers_1.ply into the app viewport
3. Happy splatting!

## Building from Source

The project uses CMake and requires a compiler with C++20 support. Configure and build a Release version with:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

During configuration, CMake may download required dependencies and sample assets:

* `nvpro_core2` is found next to the project, in the source tree, or under `build/_deps`; if it is not found, `cmake/FindNvproCore2.cmake` downloads it automatically when `NVPROCORE2_DOWNLOAD` is enabled.
* The default Bouquet of Flowers scene (`flowers_1.zip`) is downloaded and extracted unless `DISABLE_DEFAULT_SCENE=ON` is set.
* Test mesh assets such as `armadillo.obj`, `teapot.obj`, and related OBJ files are downloaded unless `DISABLE_MESH_ASSETS_DOWNLOAD=ON` is set.
* DLSS support is enabled by default through `USE_DLSS=ON`; the NGX/DLSS dependency is resolved through the nvpro_core2 CMake modules.

For a more minimal configure step, disable optional asset downloads as needed:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDISABLE_DEFAULT_SCENE=ON -DDISABLE_MESH_ASSETS_DOWNLOAD=ON -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```
